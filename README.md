# 2015-Retro-Python
A full port of 2015-Retro to PyFRC

Talked to some people, had some time on the weekend, and this came out.
For documentation that's actually good, go to 2015-Retro, I guess.
It's the same thing anyways.

I still don't know if I love or hate python OOP. Java is good at some things, it turn out.
